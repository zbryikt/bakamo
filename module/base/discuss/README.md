# @servebase/discuss

## Frontend Usage

You can use `@plotdb/block` to load `@servebase/discuss`:

    manager.from {name: "@servebase/discuss"}, {root: document.body, data: data} .then -> ...

where `data` is an object with following fields:

 - `host`: an object providing host api including:
   - `avatar({comment})`: return URL to the avatar for the given `comment` object (see `Comment Object` below).
 - `uri`: uri of the discuss thread to load. ignored if `slug` is provided.
 - `slug`: slug of the discuss thread to load. if omitted, `uri` will be used instead.
   - either `slug` or `uri` should be provided, otherwise all threads will be loaded.

Alternatively, you can overwrite this block's DOM or even build a block from scratch by calling `discuss` constructor directly. See `src/block.ls` for more information.


## Backend Usage


import `@servebase/discuss` and initialize `discuss` backend API by following code:

    require! <[@servebase/discuss]>
    (backend) <- (->module.exports = it)  _
    discuss {backend, route: route, api: api}

`@servebase/discuss` will route its APIs through `api` of the given `route` object (aka through `route.api`), or leave this job to you if `route` is omitted.

Additionally, `api` is an customizable object containing API extensions for discuss to call, including:

 - `role({discuss, users})`: return a Promise resolving with a hash mapping from user key to a list string for its corresponding roles. `discuss` is the Discuss object we want to resolve.
 - `perm({user, discuss, comment, action})`: return a Promise which resolves if permission granted, otherwise rejects with an Error.


## Discuss Object

You can use following fields when resolving a discuss object:

 - `slug`: slug for this discuss.
 - `key`: key for this discuss
 - `uri`: uri for this discuss, if any
 - `title`: title for this discuss, if any


## Comment Object

a comment object contains following fields:

 - `owner`: user id for who create this comment.
 - `_user`: user object containing `key` and `displayname` corresponding to `owner` above.
 - `content`: an object with following fields:
   - `body`: actual content string corresponding to this comment
   - `config`: comment config object with following fields:
     - `renderer`: decide how this comment should be rendered. either empty or `markdown`.
